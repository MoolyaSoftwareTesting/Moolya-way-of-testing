Moolya Way of Testing. What is it? 

A lot of people focus on skills.
Testing skills are needed to execute our work.
Skills solve the problem of "how to do things?"
Context understanding solves the problem of "Why to do things?" and "What things to do (and not do)?"

A lot of people in our industry are skill hungry and learning hungry. They think they are going to be obsolete or grow slow if they are going to not learn new skills and tools. While it is true but growth means to go beyond How and find answers to Why, What and When.

Moolya Way of Testing is about asking fundamental questions before jumping in. This way, we don't dig a hole in a place where what we are looking for is not there.

We solve 60% of the testing problem before testing actually begins.
If we fail to do that, we will need to give 200% to solve the problem. 100% effort to get it to the point that we realize we are wrong and then re-do it. Most UI Automation in our industry is 200% effort. Not 100%.


If you have a chance to go to Mars, of course you know you can't take everyone in the rocket. So there are going to be a few people with whom you are going to spend many years. You want your fellow travelers to be fun people.

Moolya Way of Testing needs fun people who make it easy for each other and who don't compete against each other. We solve 30% of the Testing problem through our culture. Without the right culture, organizations struggle to succeed.

They wonder why they aren't getting their Testing, QA and Automation wrong (we mean painful). They wonder so much because they have invested in the most talented people to come on board. Having a talented team and a bad culture is like asking top football teams to play in the night without the lights on.
