## Vision 

> ### Prevent bugs and tech debt for deep tech startups and startup savvy enterprises

### Why?
For ages QA and Testing roles have been linked to quality but the view of teams that test is limited to finding and reporting bugs. Major upstream                  contributors to bugs are Culture, Customer Understanding, Design, Architecture and Documentation. Instead of preventing bugs in these areas, the                    industry is largely enjoying building safety nets downstream. That's a waste of human potential. 

The top 2% of orgs in the world build culture, product and engineering teams that prevent bugs upstream and not do that downstream.

### How?

### Wide

- Influence the culture of the org
- Talk to people upstream
- Build the culture of quality
- Understand customers and users
- Understand revenue model
- Understand industry
- Understand competition
- Understand business contexts

### Deep

- Build product test teams (not teams who just test in sprints)
- Build tech test teams (who are not automation engineers but review code)


## The philosophies of testing we subscribe to

<details><summary>Software Testing is a feedback loop</summary>
<p>


 * Someone has a business idea to solve a pain point across customers.
 * That someone wants to build a product that solves the identified pain.
 * That someone builds a product hiring product and engineering teams.
 * That someone wants an internal feedback system about the product.
 * That someone has many questions in mind.
 * That someone wants to know “Are we ready to invest in marketing spend? “
 * That someone wants to know if customers have obstacles in using the product.
 * That someone wants to know if customers’ pain is really solved through the product.
 * That someone hopes everyone in the company evolves based on the feedback.
 * The feedback loop to evolve is called Testing.

## 📖 Understanding context


<details><summary>💰 Business context</summary>
<p>
     
Business wants a specific customer pain solved through product. They want customer getting added month on month. They want revenue to grow, profits to grow. To understand the busniess context one to find answers to questions like
* What's their bussiness mission?
* Vision of the customer
* Customer's Org culture
* How does the customer make money?
* How do users discover the customer and their products?
* What is the USP of the customer?
* Who are the competitors? & How to compare them ?
* Short Term, Long Term goals
* Claims made & Claims customer are unable to achieve
* Purpose of the product
* Name of the product. Why did they name it that way? 
* History of the product
* Key risks in the product
     
</p>
</details>
    
<details><summary>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  User context</summary>
<p>

Unless the end use (our customer's customer) embraced the product the business is not gone succeed. How do we understand the context of users? 
* Who is the target audience?
* Why do you think they use the product?
* Who are the direct and indirect users?
* User persona models
* How easily is it available to the users?
* Consistency with other familiar products?
* How easy/hard is for the competitor product user to migrate to your product?

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>👨‍💻  Tech context  </summary>
<p>
     
Without know hows of how product is build and how it is solving the customer problem testers will not be able to test the product efficiently. The CTOs and VP Engineering want from testers is Speed. They don't want Testing to become a bottleneck. By understanding the building blocks of the product the testers can speak to the developers in their laugage and move faster. 
* Structure of the product - Code, Hardware,server architecture, non-executables,EULA,user guide.
* Interfaces - GUI, APIs, third party interface, system interface.
* Why this technology?
* Advantages / Limitation of the tech stack.
* Platforms supported

 ## 🥇Value 
<details><summary>There are three important stakeholders for Testers.</summary>
<p>
     
```
The Business, 
The Product Team (PO and BA), and 
The Tech (CTO, VP, Dev)
```
     
Our goal as Moolya is to be able to cater to all these stakeholders by structuring our test coverage to capture value for all these stakeholders. A bug we find may not be of interest to the tech team but we ferry it across to Product Teams to decide if it needs to be fixed.
To do that, we need to be able to understand their context really well, build strong relationships with them, and influence them with the right information helping the product and the people working on it, succeed. 
To do that, 
* We ask the right questions at the right time, politely and fearlessly
* We are tied to the purpose
* We do this not sporadically but in a disciplined manner
* We communicate really well
* We are focused on test coverage
* We are mission-focused
* We say “I don’t know” when we have to
* We care
* We don’t do things to please people
The above forms a fundamental to test value from Moolya to stakeholders who hire us.
Also in some contexts, we need to provide more PO value and in others more tech value.
</p>
</details> 

     
<details><summary> 📱Product value: </summary>
<p>
 
Feedback to BA and PO on the requirements and usefulness to the business. Any information or bugs assess the impact and report the impact on
* Revenue
* User acquistion
* User Retention
* User drop off
* Marketing spend usefulness
* Bottom line

</p>
</details> 
     
     
<details><summary> 💻 Tech value: </summary>
<p>
      
Feedback to developers on how they can prevent these issues and reporting bugs and observations by deeper technical investigation than surface-level issues.
The tech wants speed. Any information or bugs assess the impact and report the impact on
* Security threat
* Performance
* Battery drain
* Future readiness
* Scalability
* Compatibility

</p>
</details> 
     
<details><summary> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Customer's customer value: : </summary>
<p>

Putting yourselves in the shoes of the users, finding things that the users want and articulating the feedback in a credible way. Here again the impact on end user
* Correctness
* Usability
* Overall user experience
* Consistency
* Charima - Aesthetics, uniqueness, gamification

</p>
</details>

<details><summary> ⚙️Test value: : </summary>
<p> 
Implementing different coverage models. How thoroughly have you examined the product with respect to choose model. So if you chose a model that is 'writing n test cases and executing all of them' then one can achieve 100% test coverage.
