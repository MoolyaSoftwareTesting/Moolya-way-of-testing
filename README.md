# üíú Moolya Way of Testing. What is it?

A lot of people focus on skills.
Testing skills are needed to execute our work.
Skills solve the problem of "how to do things?"
Context understanding solves the problem of "Why to do things?" and "What things to do (and not do)?"

A lot of people in our industry are skill hungry and learning hungry. They think they are going to be obsolete or grow slow if they are going to not learn new skills and tools. While it is true but growth means to go beyond How and find answers to Why, What and When.

>Moolya Way of Testing is about asking fundamental questions before jumping in. 

This way, we don't dig a hole in a place where what we are looking for is not there.

We solve 60% of the testing problem before testing actually begins.
If we fail to do that, we will need to give 200% to solve the problem. 100% effort to get it to the point that we realize we are wrong and then re-do it. Most UI Automation in our industry is 200% effort. Not 100%.

If you have a chance to go to Mars, of course you know you can't take everyone in the rocket. So there are going to be a few people with whom you are going to spend many years. You want your fellow travelers to be fun people.

Moolya Way of Testing needs fun people who make it easy for each other and who don't compete against each other. We solve 30% of the Testing problem through our culture. Without the right culture, organizations struggle to succeed.They wonder why they aren't getting their Testing, QA and Automation wrong (we mean painful). They wonder so much because they have invested in the most talented people to come on board. Having a talented team and a bad culture is like asking top football teams to play in the night without the lights on.


# ‚û∞ Software Testing is a feedback loop

 * Someone has a business idea to solve a pain point across customers.
 * That someone wants to build a product that solves the identified pain.
 * That someone builds a product hiring product and engineering teams.
 * That someone wants an internal feedback system about the product.
 * That someone has many questions in mind.
 * That someone wants to know ‚ÄúAre we ready to invest in marketing spend? ‚Äú
 * That someone wants to know if customers have obstacles in using the product.
 * That someone wants to know if customers‚Äô pain is really solved through the product.
 * That someone hopes everyone in the company evolves based on the feedback.
 * The feedback loop to evolve is called Testing.

<details><summary> üó∫Ô∏è Mental Modelling</summary>
<p>
     
Models are [simplified] respresentation of complex things. It's a way of linking theory with experiment. 
We all have it in our mind to 
- Understand
- Learn
- Explore
- Recognize
When we learn something about the model, we later apply to more complex things. 
     
>Models are central to the process of knowledge building.

Use existing models to understand/learn about software that you have to test. 
* Requirement documents
* Wireframes
* Mock screens
* Architecture diagrams 
You build models of how to test and convey what is tested. 
* Test ideas
* Test coverage 
* Test strategy
     
Our thinking capacity and quality depends on the models in our head and their usefulness in the given context. The more model you have the better you test.

### The mental models of Testing

### üí≤ value 
     
There are three important stakeholders for Testers. The Business, The Product Team (PO and BA), and The Tech (CTO, VP, Dev)
Our goal as Moolya is to be able to cater to all these stakeholders by structuring our test coverage to capture value for all these stakeholders. A bug we find may not be of interest to the tech team but we ferry it across to Product Teams to decide if it needs to be fixed.
To do that, we need to be able to understand their context really well, build strong relationships with them, and influence them with the right information helping the product and the people working on it, succeed. 
To do that, 
* We ask the right questions at the right time, politely and fearlessly
* We are tied to the purpose
* We do this not sporadically but in a disciplined manner
* We communicate really well
* We are focused on test coverage
* We are mission-focused
* We say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù when we have to
* We care
* We don‚Äôt do things to please people
The above forms a fundamental to test value from Moolya to stakeholders who hire us.
Also in some contexts, we need to provide more PO value and in others more tech value.

#### Product value: 
Feedback to BA and PO on the requirements and usefulness to the business.
#### Tech value: 
Feedback to developers on how they can prevent these issues and reporting bugs and observations by deeper technical investigation than surface-level issues.

#### Customer's customer value: 
Putting yourselves in the shoes of the users, finding things that the users want and articulating the feedback in a credible way.

#### Test value: 
Implementing different coverage models.

## Moolya Way of Testing. What isn't it?
Starting with a template, but MWT starts with requirements of BA,PO, developers, CTOs and other interested stakeholders.
Is not Agile Testing, is not TDD, is not BDD.
